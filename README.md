# NycMuseumApp
Used android studio and java to develop an Android app that can estimate the ticket prices for admissions to a list of museums in
New York City (, OR in New Jersey if you like.) When your app is running, the main activity will show a
list of museums for the user to choose from. Upon the selection of the museum, your app will navigate to a
second screen displaying a simple calculator for the cost of admissions to the museum selected. The second
screen shall also include a clickable museum image for navigation to the museumâ€™s website.
